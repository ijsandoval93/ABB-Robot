# ABB-Robot

The code in this respository was used to teach two ABB Robots that coinside in a closed cell.

Each file represents the code that was written to each robot in the cell to perform its functions.

The Load file was used for picking and placing the components after the operator was finished and it was in a safe state.

The Unload file was used for testing the product and checking whether the product either passed or failed its inspection.

ABB robots use Rapid language in their program RobotStudio to be taught.

*** NOTE: This code has been finalized and no further modifications will be implemented. 5/1/23. ***
